## 🧠 Inspiration & Credits

This project was developed as part of a **TBC** assignment.

The layout and visual style were **inspired by** the following Figma community design:  
🎨 [Banking Dashboard – Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1382980970454743696/banking-dashboard?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR5RbOKjskHF9rZJkLjDJwcpwH4um5ok8lAqOpdH7IbnZaJzdx_Ktb1naubIzA_aem_nb1p1OVKRyKakVyP97s_Wg)

Credit to the original designer for the interface idea.  
All code (HTML & CSS) was written from scratch by me without using JavaScript or external UI libraries.
